          Roots and Révolutionnaire launch leather goods and apparel collection
        </h1>
        <small> by Matei Onea - 5h ago</small>

        <p>
          Outdoor lifestyle brand Roots and mission-based organization
          Révolutionnaire have launched their next collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Titled Révolutionnaire by the Roots, the collaboration is a result of
          a year-long partnership between the two companies. Beginning in
          February 2021, they released the Dreams Fuel Revolution t-shirt. Their
          collection will feature a signature co-branded hoodie and sweatpants,
          graphic t-shirts, and a weekender bag inspired by the Roots Banff Bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          “With our shared values of inclusivity and authenticity, designing the
          collection together was inspiring for all of us and we feel honored to
          be able to use our platform at Roots to amplify their story,” said
          chief product officer at Roots, Karuna Scheinfeld.“The outcome is a
          beautiful and meaningful collection that we think our community will
          love.”

        <p>
          Révolutionnaire, which began as a dance apparel company, soon expanded
          its aims when co-founders Nia and Justice Faith Betty realised the
          need for diversity in dance apparel. The two sisters began to focus on
          creating a line which had a variety of different skin tones.
        </p>
        <p>
          “As a young dancer, it was challenging to enjoy my passion for dance
          without apparel that made me comfortable in my own skin,” said Nia
          Faith Betty. “To create a color palette that accurately reflected
          people of all backgrounds, I spent hours scanning the skin tones of
          fellow Howard students and matching these back to exact fabric colors.
          These are the colors used on our Révolutionnaire apparel and
          accessories and those present in the Révolutionnaire by Roots
          collaboration.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by the social change element of the Roots and Révolutionnaire
          collaboration is an Awards Jacket emblazoned with the words
          revolutionary, unapologetic, enlightened, empowered, determined and
          fearless on it. The products are also available in a gender-free
          silhouette, and can be bought at select Roots stores as well as both
          of the brands’ websites.
